First week:

Intro: Due to some other things in life coming up its been a busy week and there are some exercises i havent done which ofc is not an excuse as its my own priorities.
That being said the tasks i havent done i feel like i have gotten the hang on in some of the later tasks and regarding the tasks i didnt complete or couldnt finish i plan on going back through to make sure i keep up with the current lessons

Day 2 exercices: Havent been done but methods from this task has been used later on
Day 3 exercises: Everything except for the think for yourself tasks have been done here but the same methods have been used in the next task
Day 4 exercises: 
Exercise 0: Everything has been done
Exercise 1: Here everything has been done except for getEmployeeByName as em.find requires a primary key and i didnt really know how else to structure it so it could use name which isnt a primary key
the other thing that hasnt been done is JUnit tests for existing class as its JUnit 5 thats under the dependencies and we learnt JUNit 4 a group member of mine did ask one of the teachers about it but no fast fix was found 
Exercise 2: DTO class was made as in the task
Exercise 3: Here in the first part for the /all path i ended up not going through the facade just so it can be seen that it can go through the DTO and show up on the web but for the rest of them i went through the facade methods unsuccesfully by trying to create an EmployeeDTO with the facade method it needed as they return an Employee which is needed to construct an EmployeeDTO but to take an example the getEmployeeById only returned a {"Id":0} in the web
Exercise 4: .war file was made an deployed without issue BUT i couldnt ssh into the persistence file as when i reached /tomcat/webapps the only folder available was /manager so i tried to manually change the credentials in netbeans and deploy it again but was unsuccesful in getting it online and was met by a 404 error
